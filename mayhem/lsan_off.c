/*
 * lsan_off.c — turn LeakSanitizer OFF at BUILD time, fleet-wide policy.
 *
 * -fsanitize=address always bundles LeakSanitizer in and offers no flag to exclude just it.
 * Leaks are not the bug class this fleet fuzzes for (memory corruption + UB are), and a leaky
 * but otherwise harmless allocation on every rejected input drowns out the real findings.
 *
 * The sanctioned mechanism is this single build-time hook: the ASan runtime calls
 * __lsan_is_turned_off() once at startup and skips leak reporting when it returns non-zero.
 * ASan and UBSan stay fully active. Runtime toggling (a disable/enable pair around a call
 * path) is FORBIDDEN by the spec — unreliable in practice — and so is overriding the
 * sanitizer option-string hooks, which belong to Mayhem alone.
 *
 * Wiring (see mayhem/build.sh): this TU is compiled with $SANITIZER_FLAGS into
 * mayhem/build-out/lsan_off.o and PREPENDED, together with the DWARF3 anchor object, onto
 * every rustc link line by the generated `-Clinker` cc-wrapper — so it lands in every
 * sanitized fuzz binary, not just one of them.
 *
 * The declaration below MUST stay on ONE line: the conformance gate's detector is a
 * line-wise grep for `int __lsan_is_turned_off (`.
